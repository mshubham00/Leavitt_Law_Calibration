The golden data contains photometry with quality index less than or equal to 3 and RUWE less than 1.4 for gaia paralax. Raw dataset contains 103 Galactic Cepheids pulsating in fundamental mode. Their periods are measured in days and scaled logarithmically. The distance modulus is derived from the Gaia DR3 parallax filtered with RUWE < 1.4, the color excess is adopted from Fernie measurements, and photometric magnitudes are collected in the BVIJHK bands. The distribution of each observable against the period is depicted in the following sequence of pair plots. A quick glance shows no clear correlation in the plots.

A dataset of 150 Galactic Classical Cepheid (GCC) is prepared for the calibration of Period-Luminosity (PL) relation. The raw dataset partially adopted from \cite{storm2011calibrating}. For each Cepheid, pulsation period is given in logarithmic scale, color excess is estimated with respect to B-V index using \cite{1994fernie} method, distance modulus is measured using IRBS method \cite{storm2011calibrating} and the apparent magnitude is observed in six bands - B, V, R, I, J, H and K. The dataset is given in table . 

\section{Dataset Cleaning}
\subsection{Filtering Outliers using instability strip cretaria }
Prior to analysis, Cepheids with inconsistent photometric measurements must be removed from the dataset. To identify the outliers, the period-color relation is employed. This approach is effective because both the intrinsic color and the period of a Cepheid are independent of distance. Since we know that a Cepheid's period strongly correlates with its luminosity, plotting the period against color mimics the features of the color-magnitude diagram — particularly the region known as the instability strip.

Within the instability strip, short-period Cepheids appear lower, while long-period (and thus brighter) Cepheids appear higher. Cepheids that significantly deviate from the linear trend of the instability strip are likely affected by incorrect photometry in specific bands and are therefore classified as outliers. In general, the intrinsic color index for any pair of photometric bands can be calculated as shown in equation \ref{color}.

\begin{align}
	(V-K)_0 = (V-K) - (R_V - R_K) E_{BV}
	\label{color}
\end{align}

\subsection{Based on photometric quality index}
Provided dataset also marks quality of photometry with an index value from 1 to 6, where 1 is fine quality and 6 is relatively bad photometry. I have prepared a golden dataset with quality index less 3 which contains 62 Galactic Cepheids. 

\subsection{Cleaned Dataset}
After cleaning the outliers, the dataset can be used for the calibration of Leavitt Law. Following step would transform observed apparent magnitude into true apparent magnitude using extinction law \cite{2007fouque} and color excess measurements. This is shown in the adjecent plot - red region transforming into blue region. In the plot, period (x-axis) plotted against luminosity (y-axis). The apparent magnitude, B and K magnitude depicted with red dashed line. Remaining bands - V, I, J and H lie in between the two edges of colored area. After bandwise extinction correction, true apparent magnitude results as depicted by blue region. Note that the shift in B band is much larger than K band, as light of short wavelength is much more sensitive to extinction compare to longer ones. After extinction correction, resulting magnitude becomes brighter and the area of red region squeezed to blue region. At this point, no clear correlation between the period and luminosity is evident. 

\begin{align}
	m_0 = m_\lambda - R_\lambda * E_{BV}
	\label{true_apparent}
\end{align}

Following step adjusts the distance for each Cepheid, transforming true apparent magnitudes into true absolute magnitudes, as depicted by the yellow region. At this point, a linear trend begins to emerge between the period and intrinsic luminosity of the Cepheids which known as the Leavitt Law.

\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{align}
	M_0 = m_\lambda - R_\lambda * E_{BV} - \mu
	\label{true_absolute}
\end{align}

Another version of extinction free luminosity (true absolute magnitude) is reddening free magnitude which derived through Wesenhiet function \cite{1982madore}. An important aspect of the Wesenheit magnitude is that does not require the measurement of color excess, rather depends on color index. For multiband photometry (BVIJHK), I considered all the fifteen permulations of color indices to understand the key differences between them. It is crucial because wesenheit magitude for respective band $m_\lambda$ is derived from reddening ratio $R{12}_\lambda$. 

For residual correlation of period-luminosity relation and period-wesenheit relation Composite Leavitt Law (CLL)
 them for the Leavitt Law calibration. The cyan and green regions in the plot represent two versions of the Wesenheit magnitudes—HK and JH, respectively. The lower and upper edges of these regions correspond to the B and K bands, while the shaded region encompasses the remaining four bands used in the Wesenheit magnitude. All other versions of the Wesenheit magnitude lie between the HK and JH regions, as explicitly shown in Figure \ref{wesen_compare}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{clean/wesenheit_comparison.pdf}
	\caption{Fifteen versions of composite wesenheit magnitude derived for BVIJHK photometry.}\label{wesen_compare}
\end{figure}

The four subplots of Figure \ref{wesen_compare} compare all fifteen versions of the Wesenheit magnitudes. Each plot includes the HK and JH Wesenheit magnitudes in the background as a reference for ease of comparison. It is clear that not all color bases for the Wesenheit lead to the same magnitude. For example, the area covered by the B-to-K Wesenheit of HK is much larger than that of the 
BV-based or other Wesenheit magnitudes. Lesser difference between the two edges of a given Wesenheit makes it a better choice for the calibration process, as all Wesenheit magnitudes of that color suggest the same reddening-free magnitude and only contain errors due to the distance modulus. Based on this observation, the VI, VK, IH, and JK-based Wesenheit magnitudes are selected for the analysis.

To deduce period-luminosity relations for the given dataset, the first step would be to convert the apparent magnitude into absolute magnitude. For this, estimated modulus and extinction need to be subtracted from the apparent magnitude. To calculate the extinction for each band, I have the rearranged definition of reddening ratio, $A_\lambda = R_\lambda \times E(B-V)$, (section 4.3) and adopted the value $R_V = 3.23$ along with extinction law given in table 4 of \cite{fouque2007new} which aids in determining reddening ratio for other bands. Calculated value of $R_\lambda$ is given in table ...

\subsection{Cepheus}
\subsubsection*{ CR Cep }
CR Cephei (CR Cep) is located in the constellation Cepheus. 
The period of pulsation of CR Cephei is approximately 8.9 days, which means it takes about 8.9 days for the star to complete one cycle of brightness variation. During its maximum brightness phase, CR Cephei becomes brighter, and during its minimum brightness phase, it becomes dimmer. The amplitude of these brightness variations is typically several magnitudes.

In summary, CR Cephei (CR Cep) is a classical Cepheid variable star located in the constellation Cepheus. It undergoes regular pulsations with a period of approximately 8.9 days and follows a well-defined period-luminosity relationship. The study of CR Cephei and other Cepheid variables provides valuable insights into stellar pulsations, distance measurements, and the structure and evolution of the universe.

\subsubsection*{ CP Cep }
CP Cep is a variable star located in the constellation Cepheus. It is classified as a pulsating variable star of the Delta Scuti type. Delta Scuti stars are typically main sequence or slightly evolved stars that pulsate with multiple periods in the range of a few hours to a few days.

The variability of CP Cep is caused by its pulsations, which are driven by internal pressure changes and the presence of non-radial oscillations within the star. These pulsations cause the star to expand and contract, resulting in changes in its radius, temperature, and luminosity.

The period of variability of CP Cep is approximately 0.16 days, or about 3.8 hours. During its pulsation cycle, the star experiences regular variations in brightness. The amplitude of these variations can be small, typically on the order of a few hundredths to a few tenths of a magnitude.

The study of Delta Scuti variables like CP Cep provides insights into the internal structure and physical processes occurring within these stars. By analyzing their pulsation properties, astronomers can determine fundamental parameters such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature. Delta Scuti stars are also used as astroseismology targets, allowing astronomers to study the internal structure and dynamics of stars by analyzing their pulsation frequencies.

CP Cep and other Delta Scuti variables are important in the study of stellar evolution, as they provide valuable information about the processes occurring in intermediate-mass stars. They also serve as useful tools for calibrating stellar models and for testing theories of stellar pulsation and evolution.


\subsubsection*{ d Ceph }
Delta Cephei ($\delta$ Cephei) is a well-known and important variable star located in the constellation Cepheus. It is the prototype of a class of variable stars called Cepheid variables, which are named after this star.

Delta Cephei is a pulsating variable star, meaning it undergoes regular and predictable changes in brightness. It exhibits a primary pulsation period of approximately 5.366 days, during which its brightness varies from its maximum magnitude to its minimum magnitude and back again. This period-luminosity relationship allows astronomers to use Delta Cephei and other Cepheid variables as standard candles to measure distances in the universe.

The variations in brightness of Delta Cephei are caused by radial pulsations, where the star expands and contracts in a spherical manner. As the star expands, its surface temperature decreases, causing it to appear dimmer. Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface temperature increases, leading to a brighter appearance. The pulsation period is directly related to the star's intrinsic luminosity, allowing astronomers to determine its distance based on its observed period and apparent magnitude.

Delta Cephei has a well-studied light curve, which shows the changes in its brightness over time. By analyzing this light curve, astronomers can gain insights into the physical properties of the star, such as its mass, radius, and effective temperature.

The discovery of the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variables, including Delta Cephei, played a crucial role in establishing the cosmic distance ladder and measuring the distances to galaxies and other astronomical objects. Cepheids are used as standard candles in the calibration of other distance measurement techniques, such as supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation.

In summary, Delta Cephei is a Cepheid variable star located in the constellation Cepheus. It is the prototype of its class and exhibits regular pulsations, allowing astronomers to use it as a standard candle for distance measurements. The study of Delta Cephei and other Cepheid variables has significantly contributed to our understanding of stellar evolution and the scale of the universe.


\subsection{Camelopardalis}


\subsubsection*{ RX Cam }
RX Camelopardalis (RX Cam) is a variable star located in the constellation Camelopardalis. It is classified as a Mira variable, a type of pulsating variable star that undergoes regular and significant changes in brightness over a period of several months to years.

RX Cam is a red giant star in the later stages of its evolution. It exhibits pulsations in its outer layers, specifically radial pulsations, where the star expands and contracts in a regular pattern. These pulsations cause the star's radius and temperature to vary, resulting in changes in its overall luminosity.

The period of variability for RX Cam is approximately 317 days. During its maximum brightness phase, the star can reach a magnitude of around 8, making it visible to the naked eye. However, during its minimum brightness phase, it can fade to around 14th magnitude or even fainter, becoming challenging to observe without a telescope.

The study of Mira variables like RX Cam provides important insights into stellar evolution, mass loss processes, and the enrichment of the interstellar medium. These stars are known to undergo significant mass loss, creating extended envelopes of gas and dust around them. The material ejected by Mira variables contributes to the chemical enrichment of the galaxy and the formation of new stars.

Observations of RX Cam and other Mira variables help astronomers refine models of stellar pulsations, study the mass loss mechanisms, and understand the dynamics and structure of their atmospheres. Additionally, these stars are used as distance indicators in astronomy, allowing us to measure the distances to objects within our galaxy and beyond.

\subsubsection*{ RW Cam }
RW Cam is a variable star located in the constellation Camelopardalis. It is classified as a semi-regular variable star, meaning its brightness varies irregularly over time with some periodicity or regularity.

The variability of RW Cam is primarily attributed to pulsations and changes in its outer layers. It undergoes radial pulsations, where the star expands and contracts, causing fluctuations in its size, temperature, and luminosity. These pulsations result from the instability of the star's outer layers and are thought to be related to changes in its internal structure and composition.

The period of variability of RW Cam is approximately 110 days. However, it's important to note that the star's brightness changes are not strictly periodic, and there can be variations in the duration and amplitude of its pulsations.

RW Cam is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. AGB stars are in the late stages of stellar evolution, characterized by their large size, low surface temperature, and high luminosity. They are typically old, evolved stars with exhausted hydrogen fuel in their cores.

The study of semi-regular and Mira variable stars like RW Cam provides valuable information about stellar evolution, mass loss, and the enrichment of the interstellar medium with newly synthesized elements. These stars also contribute to the formation of dust and molecules in their atmospheres, which have implications for the chemical and physical processes occurring in the universe.

Observations of RW Cam and similar variable stars help astronomers refine models of stellar evolution and understand the mechanisms driving the pulsations and mass loss in evolved stars. They also contribute to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way galaxy and the role of variable stars in its evolution.


\subsection{Cassiopeia}
\subsubsection*{SU Cas}
SU Cassiopeiae, often referred to as SU Cas, is another notable Cepheid variable star. It is located in the constellation Cassiopeia and has been studied extensively due to its pulsation properties and its role in distance measurements.

SU Cas is classified as a classical Cepheid and exhibits regular pulsations with a period of approximately 6.85 days. Like other Cepheids, SU Cas goes through a cycle of expansion and contraction, resulting in variations in its brightness over time.

The study of SU Cas and its pulsation behavior has contributed to our understanding of the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheids, which allows astronomers to estimate the distance to these stars and calibrate the cosmic distance ladder.

In addition to its importance in distance measurements, SU Cas has also been used to study various aspects of stellar astrophysics. Observations of SU Cas have provided insights into the mass, temperature, chemical composition, and evolutionary stage of Cepheid stars.

The study of SU Cas and other Cepheids has played a significant role in cosmology and the determination of distances to galaxies and other celestial objects. By understanding the pulsation properties of Cepheids and their period-luminosity relationship, astronomers can accurately measure cosmic distances and make important discoveries about the scale and structure of the universe.

\subsubsection*{ SY Cas }
SY Cassiopeiae, also known as SY Cas, is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star with long periods and large changes in brightness. Mira variables like SY Cas are typically evolved, red giant stars in the late stages of their evolution.

SY Cas undergoes regular pulsations, with a period of approximately 358 days. During its pulsation cycle, its brightness can vary by several magnitudes. The pulsations are caused by periodic expansions and contractions of the star's outer layers, which result in changes in its surface temperature and luminosity.

The pulsations of Mira variables are primarily driven by a process known as thermal pulsation. As the star expands, its outer layers cool down, causing the gas to condense and form molecules and dust grains. This dust acts as a blanket, trapping heat and causing the star to regain its brightness. The release of energy leads to another expansion phase, and the cycle repeats.

The variations in brightness of SY Cas can be observed in its light curve, which shows the changes in brightness over time. The light curve of Mira variables typically exhibits a slow rise to maximum brightness, followed by a slower decline to minimum brightness, known as the primary minimum. Some Mira variables, including SY Cas, also exhibit secondary minima, which occur between two consecutive primary minima.

The study of Mira variables like SY Cas provides insights into stellar evolution, late-stage stellar pulsations, and the formation and dynamics of circumstellar envelopes. These stars play a crucial role in the enrichment of interstellar space with heavy elements and the recycling of material back into the interstellar medium.

Furthermore, Mira variables are valuable for distance measurements in astronomy. Their period-luminosity relationship, known as the Mira period-luminosity relation, allows astronomers to estimate their distances based on their observed periods and apparent magnitudes.

In summary, SY Cassiopeiae is a Mira variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. Its regular pulsations and variations in brightness are caused by expansions and contractions of its outer layers. The study of SY Cas and similar Mira variables contributes to our understanding of stellar evolution, pulsation mechanisms, and distance measurements in astronomy.

\subsubsection*{ SW Cas }
SW Cassiopeiae (SW Cas) is a cataclysmic variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It belongs to a class of cataclysmic variables known as dwarf novae, which are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star.

Dwarf novae like SW Cas undergo periodic outbursts in brightness caused by instabilities in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. The accretion disk forms when matter from the companion star transfers onto the white dwarf, spiraling inward due to gravitational forces. During periods of quiescence, the accretion rate is relatively low, and the system remains at a stable, lower level of brightness.

During an outburst, the accretion rate increases significantly, resulting in a rapid rise in brightness. The exact mechanisms behind the outbursts in dwarf novae are still the subject of ongoing research, but they are thought to be triggered by instabilities in the accretion disk, such as the thermal-viscous instability.

The outbursts of SW Cas typically last for a few days to weeks before the system returns to a quiescent state. The frequency and amplitude of the outbursts can vary from one dwarf nova to another, making each system unique in its behavior.

The study of dwarf novae like SW Cas provides insights into the dynamics of accretion disks, mass transfer processes in binary systems, and the physical properties of white dwarfs. By monitoring the outbursts and analyzing the light curves and spectra during different phases, astronomers can investigate the properties of the accretion disk, the nature of mass transfer, and the characteristics of the white dwarf.

Furthermore, dwarf novae contribute to our understanding of the overall evolution of binary star systems and the role of cataclysmic events in stellar evolution. The study of these systems helps shed light on the processes of mass transfer, angular momentum transfer, and the formation and evolution of accretion disks.

In summary, SW Cassiopeiae is a cataclysmic variable star, specifically a dwarf nova, located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It undergoes periodic outbursts in brightness caused by instabilities in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. The study of SW Cas and similar dwarf novae contributes to our understanding of accretion processes, mass transfer, and the dynamics of binary star systems.


\subsubsection*{ RS Cas }
RS Cassiopeiae (RS Cas) is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a semi-regular variable star, which means it exhibits regular variations in brightness, but with some irregularities in its pulsation pattern.

RS Cas is an evolved red giant star that undergoes pulsations caused by the expansion and contraction of its outer layers. These pulsations are driven by internal processes and are influenced by the star's mass, size, and composition. The variations in brightness of RS Cas are typically smaller in amplitude compared to other types of variable stars.

The pulsation period of RS Cas is approximately 308 days, although it can vary slightly from cycle to cycle. During its maximum brightness phase, RS Cas reaches its brightest point, while during its minimum brightness phase, it becomes dimmer. The irregularities in its pulsation pattern can lead to slight deviations from the expected behavior.

RS Cas is also known for its irregular variations in the length of its pulsation period. This phenomenon, known as period changes, can occur due to several factors, including stellar evolution, interactions with a binary companion, or changes in the star's internal structure. Studying these period changes can provide insights into the evolution and dynamics of the star.

As a semi-regular variable star, RS Cas does not follow a well-defined period-luminosity relationship like classical Cepheid variables. However, its variations in brightness still provide valuable information about the star's physical properties and can contribute to our understanding of stellar evolution.

In summary, RS Cassiopeiae (RS Cas) is a semi-regular variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It undergoes regular pulsations with a period of approximately 308 days, although with some irregularities in its pattern. The study of RS Cas and other semi-regular variables helps us understand the pulsation behavior and evolution of evolved red giant stars.


\subsubsection*{ FM Cas }
FM Cassiopeiae (FM Cas) is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a dwarf nova, which is a type of cataclysmic variable star.

Dwarf novae like FM Cas are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star. The companion star transfers mass onto the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk. Periodically, the accretion disk experiences an outburst, resulting in a sudden increase in brightness. These outbursts are caused by instabilities in the accretion disk, such as the thermal-viscous instability.

During the outburst phase, the accretion rate onto the white dwarf increases, leading to the release of a large amount of energy. This results in a rapid rise in brightness, and FM Cas can become significantly brighter than its quiescent state. The outburst phase typically lasts for a few days to weeks before the system returns to a lower level of brightness during the quiescent phase.

The study of dwarf novae like FM Cas provides insights into the dynamics of accretion disks, mass transfer processes in binary systems, and the physical properties of white dwarfs. By monitoring the outbursts and analyzing the light curves and spectra during different phases, astronomers can investigate the properties of the accretion disk, the nature of mass transfer, and the characteristics of the white dwarf.

Dwarf novae are also important for understanding the overall evolution of binary star systems and the role of cataclysmic events in stellar evolution. The study of these systems helps shed light on the processes of mass transfer, angular momentum transfer, and the formation and evolution of accretion disks.

In summary, FM Cassiopeiae (FM Cas) is a dwarf nova, a type of cataclysmic variable star, located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It undergoes periodic outbursts in brightness caused by instabilities in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. The study of FM Cas and similar dwarf novae contributes to our understanding of accretion processes, mass transfer, and the dynamics of binary star systems.


\subsubsection*{ XY Cas }
XY Cassiopeiae, also known as XY Cas, is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable star, specifically a dwarf nova. Cataclysmic variables are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf star and a companion star, where mass transfer occurs from the companion onto the white dwarf.

XY Cas exhibits sudden and dramatic increases in brightness, known as outbursts, followed by periods of quiescence. These outbursts occur irregularly and can last for a few days to several weeks. The outbursts are caused by a sudden increase in the accretion of matter from the companion star onto the white dwarf.

In cataclysmic variables like XY Cas, the companion star is often a low-mass, main-sequence star or a brown dwarf. Material from the companion star accumulates in an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The disk periodically becomes unstable and undergoes a sudden increase in accretion, resulting in the outburst.

The outburst mechanism in dwarf novae like XY Cas is known as the thermal instability model. This model proposes that variations in the accretion rate and the heating and cooling processes in the accretion disk lead to cycles of instability. When the disk becomes sufficiently heated and viscous, a large amount of matter is rapidly accreted onto the white dwarf, causing the outburst.

The study of cataclysmic variables like XY Cas provides insights into the processes of mass transfer, accretion disks, and the evolution of binary star systems. By analyzing the light curves and spectroscopic data during outburst and quiescence, astronomers can study the properties of the accretion disks, the dynamics of the mass transfer, and the characteristics of the white dwarf.

Moreover, cataclysmic variables are also valuable for understanding the process of nova explosions. Under certain conditions, the accreted matter on the white dwarf can undergo a thermonuclear runaway, resulting in a nova outburst. By studying cataclysmic variables, astronomers gain insights into the conditions necessary for novae to occur and the overall evolution of binary systems.

In summary, XY Cassiopeiae is a cataclysmic variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. Its irregular outbursts and subsequent periods of quiescence are caused by variations in the accretion of matter onto the white dwarf. The study of XY Cas and similar cataclysmic variables contributes to our understanding of mass transfer, accretion processes, and the evolution of binary star systems.

\subsubsection*{ DD Cas }
DD Cassiopeiae (DD Cas) is a binary star system located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable, specifically an eclipsing cataclysmic variable (ECV). ECVs are a type of binary star system where a white dwarf star accretes material from a companion star, leading to periodic variations in brightness and occasional eclipses.

In the case of DD Cas, the binary system consists of a white dwarf primary star and a companion star that is likely a main sequence or subgiant star. The primary star accretes material from the companion, forming an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The material from the companion star spirals down onto the white dwarf, releasing gravitational potential energy and producing bright outbursts.

DD Cas exhibits irregular and sudden increases in brightness, known as outbursts, as the accretion disk becomes unstable and experiences enhanced mass transfer. These outbursts can cause the star to brighten by several magnitudes and may last for several days to weeks. Additionally, the system also undergoes occasional eclipses when the companion star passes in front of or behind the white dwarf, resulting in temporary decreases in brightness.

The study of cataclysmic variables like DD Cas provides insights into the physics of accretion processes, mass transfer, and the dynamics of binary star systems. By observing the light curves during outbursts and eclipses, astronomers can deduce properties of the system, such as the mass and size of the stars, the mass transfer rate, and the structure and evolution of the accretion disk.

\subsubsection*{ RY Cas }
RY Cassiopeiae (RY Cas) is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a semiregular variable star of the Mira type. Mira variables are evolved stars that undergo pulsations, causing regular changes in their brightness over extended periods of time.

RY Cas is a red giant star that experiences long-period variations in its brightness. The period of variability for RY Cas is approximately 430 days, although this period can vary somewhat from one cycle to another. During its pulsation cycle, RY Cas undergoes significant changes in brightness, with an amplitude of several magnitudes.

The pulsations in RY Cas are believed to be caused by the star's outer layers expanding and contracting in a radial direction. As the star expands, its surface area increases, causing it to become cooler and less luminous, resulting in a decrease in brightness. Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface area decreases, causing it to become hotter and more luminous, leading to an increase in brightness.

The exact mechanism behind the pulsations in Mira variables like RY Cas is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of processes, including the opacity-driven pulsation mechanism and the presence of stellar pulsation modes.

Studying Mira variables like RY Cas provides important insights into stellar evolution, particularly the late stages of stellar evolution when stars transition to become red giants. By monitoring the changes in brightness and other properties over time, astronomers can learn about the internal structure, mass loss, and nuclear burning processes in these evolved stars.

\subsubsection*{ RW Cas }
RW Cas is a variable star located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star known for its long and regular period of variation.

Mira variables like RW Cas are evolved red giant stars that undergo pulsations due to changes in their internal structure and dynamics. These pulsations cause the star to expand and contract, leading to variations in its brightness over a period of several months to a few years.

The pulsation period of RW Cas is approximately 435 days. During its pulsation cycle, the star goes through phases of maximum brightness (maximum light) and minimum brightness (minimum light). The amplitude of these brightness variations can be significant, with the star becoming several magnitudes brighter at maximum light compared to its minimum light.

The variability of RW Cas is primarily caused by changes in its outer layers, which result in variations in temperature, radius, and luminosity. As the star expands, its surface temperature decreases, leading to a decrease in its overall luminosity. Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface temperature increases, resulting in an increase in luminosity.

V Lacertae, also known as V Lac, is a variable star located in the constellation Lacerta. It is classified as a dwarf nova, a type of cataclysmic variable star. Cataclysmic variables are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf star and a companion star, where mass transfer from the companion onto the white dwarf leads to periodic outbursts of brightness.

V Lacertae exhibits recurring outbursts that occur irregularly but typically last for a few days to several weeks. These outbursts are caused by a sudden increase in the accretion of matter from the companion star onto the white dwarf. During the outburst, the brightness of V Lacertae increases significantly.

The outbursts in V Lacertae are triggered by the accumulation of matter in an accretion disk around the white dwarf. As the matter in the disk reaches a critical density or temperature, an instability called the thermal-viscous instability occurs, leading to a sudden increase in the mass transfer rate and the brightness of the system.

After the outburst, V Lacertae enters a period of quiescence, where its brightness returns to a lower level. During this phase, the accretion rate decreases, and the system remains relatively stable until the next outburst occurs.

\subsubsection*{ TX Cyg }
TX Cyg is a cataclysmic variable star located in the constellation Cygnus. It is classified as a dwarf nova, which is a subtype of cataclysmic variables characterized by recurrent outbursts.

In a cataclysmic variable system like TX Cyg, there is a close binary system consisting of a white dwarf star and a companion star. The companion star, often a main-sequence star, transfers mass onto the white dwarf. This material forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf, and periodically, a sudden increase in the mass transfer rate or an instability in the disk causes an outburst.

During an outburst, the brightness of TX Cyg increases significantly over a short period of time. The outburst is a result of a sudden release of gravitational potential energy as the accreted material falls onto the white dwarf and undergoes nuclear reactions. The outburst can last for days to weeks before the system gradually returns to a quiescent state.

Between outbursts, TX Cyg remains at a lower brightness level, referred to as its quiescent state. The time between outbursts can vary, ranging from days to months or even longer. This recurrent pattern of outbursts and quiescence is characteristic of dwarf novae.

\subsubsection*{ AA Mon }
AA Monocerotis, also known as AA Mon, is a variable star located in the constellation Monoceros. It is classified as a W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type eclipsing binary star. W UMa stars are close binary systems consisting of two main-sequence stars that orbit each other in a relatively tight orbit.

AA Monocerotis is characterized by its short period and shallow eclipses. The two stars in the system are so close together that they share a common envelope of gas. The orbital period of AA Mon is around 0.3866 days (approximately 9 hours and 16 minutes), which is the time it takes for the stars to complete one orbit around their common center of mass.

During an eclipse, the brightness of AA Mon decreases as one star passes in front of the other, blocking some of the light from the companion. However, the eclipses in W UMa systems are different from those in typical eclipsing binaries. Instead of complete eclipses where one star is completely hidden by the other, W UMa systems undergo partial eclipses where both stars are always partially visible.

The light curve of AA Mon shows a continuous variation in brightness due to the overlapping of the two stars' light during their orbit. This characteristic light curve shape is referred to as a "W-type light curve" and is typical of W UMa systems.

The study of AA Monocerotis and other W UMa-type eclipsing binaries provides important information about the physical properties of these systems, such as their masses, radii, and temperatures. It also offers insights into the mechanisms that govern their evolution and dynamics.

\subsubsection*{ SV Mon }
SV Mon is a variable star located in the constellation Monoceros. It is classified as an Algol-type eclipsing binary star. Algol-type binaries consist of two stars that orbit each other in an eccentric orbit, and as a result, one star periodically passes in front of the other, causing regular and predictable changes in brightness.

In the case of SV Mon, the two stars in the binary system are a main-sequence star and a subgiant or giant star. The more massive star is referred to as the primary, while the less massive star is called the secondary. As the secondary star passes in front of the primary along our line of sight, it causes an eclipse, resulting in a decrease in the overall brightness of the system. This eclipse is known as the primary eclipse.

The primary eclipse in SV Mon is partial, meaning that the secondary star does not completely block the light from the primary. This leads to a decrease in brightness during the primary eclipse, but the system does not experience a complete and total loss of light.

The period of the eclipses in SV Mon is approximately 1.753 days. During each orbital cycle, there is a primary eclipse when the secondary star passes in front of the primary, causing a decrease in brightness, and a secondary eclipse when the primary star passes in front of the secondary, causing a smaller decrease in brightness.

The study of Algol-type eclipsing binaries like SV Mon provides valuable information about stellar properties, such as their masses, radii, and temperatures.

Beta Doradus ($\beta$ Dor) is a variable star located in the constellation Dorado. It is a type of pulsating variable star known as a Beta Cephei variable. These stars are early-type main sequence or slightly evolved stars that exhibit radial pulsations, meaning they expand and contract rhythmically.

Beta Doradus is notable for its short pulsation period, which lasts around a few hours to a few days. The exact period of variability for Beta Dor can vary slightly over time. During its pulsation cycle, the star's radius, temperature, and luminosity change, leading to variations in its brightness.

The pulsations in Beta Dor are caused by a combination of mechanisms, including the heat and pressure changes in the star's outer layers due to the kappa mechanism, which is the same mechanism responsible for pulsations in Cepheid stars. The kappa mechanism is a feedback process where the opacity of the stellar material changes with temperature, leading to an instability that drives the pulsations.

Eclipsing binaries are binary star systems in which the two stars orbit each other in such a way that they periodically pass in front of and behind each other as seen from Earth, causing observable changes in brightness.

TW CMa consists of two stars: a primary star and a secondary star. The primary star is typically larger and more massive than the secondary star. As the two stars orbit each other, there are two main types of eclipses that occur.

The primary eclipse, also known as the primary minimum, happens when the secondary star passes in front of the primary star, partially or completely blocking its light from reaching Earth. This results in a decrease in brightness observed from our perspective.

The secondary eclipse, or secondary minimum, occurs when the primary star passes in front of the secondary star, causing another decrease in brightness. The secondary eclipse is generally less pronounced than the primary eclipse since the secondary star is usually smaller and less luminous than the primary star.

By studying the changes in brightness during the eclipses, astronomers can gather information about the physical properties of the stars in the system, such as their sizes, masses, and temperatures. Additionally, the timing and duration of the eclipses provide insights into the orbital period and the distance between the stars.

RY CMa is also known for its extensive circumstellar envelope, consisting of a shell of ejected material surrounding the star. This envelope is created by the intense stellar winds and mass loss occurring as the star evolves. The presence of the envelope contributes to the star's variability, as it can interact with the stellar winds and affect the observed brightness changes.

The study of RY CMa and similar hypergiants provides valuable insights into the late stages of stellar evolution, mass loss processes, and the dynamics of massive stars.

\subsubsection*{ AQ Pup }
AQ Puppis (AQ Pup) is a variable star located in the constellation Puppis. It is classified as a classical Cepheid variable, a type of pulsating variable star that follows a specific period-luminosity relationship.

Cepheid variables like AQ Pup are important in astronomy because their pulsations are directly related to their intrinsic brightness. This allows astronomers to use them as "standard candles" to measure distances to other galaxies and determine the scale of the universe. By observing the period of pulsation and the apparent brightness of a Cepheid, astronomers can calculate its absolute magnitude and, thus, its distance.

AQ Pup has a pulsation period of approximately 4.5 days. During each pulsation cycle, the star undergoes radial pulsations, expanding and contracting in size. As it expands, its surface temperature decreases, causing it to appear dimmer. As it contracts, its surface temperature increases, causing it to appear brighter. This cycle repeats with a regular period, giving AQ Pup its characteristic variability.

The period-luminosity relation for Cepheids like AQ Pup states that there is a direct relationship between the pulsation period of the star and its intrinsic luminosity.

BN Pup (also known as Nova Puppis 1942) is a cataclysmic variable star located in the constellation Puppis. It is classified as a nova, which is a type of cataclysmic variable characterized by sudden and dramatic increases in brightness.

BN Pup experienced a nova eruption in 1942, during which its brightness increased significantly over a short period of time. This nova event was observed and studied by astronomers, leading to its designation as Nova Puppis 1942.

The outburst of BN Pup was caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf star in a close binary system. The white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star, and when enough material accumulates on its surface, a thermonuclear explosion occurs. This explosion releases a tremendous amount of energy, causing the sudden increase in brightness observed during a nova eruption.

Following the nova eruption, the brightness of BN Pup gradually declined over time as the ejected material expanded and dissipated. The star eventually returned to its pre-nova quiescent state, but it may continue to exhibit smaller variations in brightness due to ongoing accretion and other processes in the binary system.

VZ Puppis (VZ Pup) is a variable star located in the constellation Puppis. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable, specifically a dwarf nova.

Dwarf novae are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star, typically a red dwarf. The variability of VZ Pup is caused by the periodic outbursts that occur in these systems. The outbursts are triggered by the transfer of mass from the companion star to the white dwarf through an accretion disk.

During quiescence, VZ Pup remains in a relatively dim state. However, periodically, the accretion disk becomes unstable and experiences an increase in brightness. This results in an outburst where the system becomes significantly brighter. The outburst is characterized by a rapid rise in brightness, followed by a slower decline back to the quiescent state.

The time between outbursts, known as the recurrence period, can vary from several days to several years. The duration of the outburst itself can range from a few days to several weeks.

CT Car, also known as HD 95160, is a variable star located in the constellation Carina. It is classified as a Cepheid variable, specifically a classical Cepheid.

Cepheid variables like CT Car are important for several reasons. One of the most significant is their Period-Luminosity relation, which states that there is a direct correlation between the pulsation period of a Cepheid and its intrinsic luminosity. This relation allows astronomers to use Cepheids as distance indicators, as their period can be easily measured from their light curves, and their luminosity can be inferred from the Period-Luminosity relation. By comparing the observed brightness of a Cepheid to its intrinsic luminosity, astronomers can determine its distance from Earth, which is crucial for measuring cosmic distances and calibrating the cosmic distance scale.

The period of variability of CT Car is approximately 4.87 days. It undergoes pulsations where its brightness varies as it expands and contracts. During its pulsation cycle, it reaches maximum brightness at one point and then gradually fades before brightening again. The amplitude of its brightness variations can be several magnitudes.

The study of Cepheid variables like CT Car also provides insights into stellar evolution. Cepheids are typically intermediate- to high-mass stars that have reached a stage of instability due to the presence of a hydrogen-burning shell surrounding a helium core.

LBVs like l Car are known for their extreme instability and eruptive behavior. They experience outbursts and eruptions that result in significant changes in their luminosity and temperature. These eruptions are believed to be caused by instabilities in the star's outer layers, such as the ejection of mass and the formation of dense stellar winds.

l Car has experienced several major eruptions throughout its recorded history, with the most recent and largest known eruption occurring in the mid-19th century. During these eruptions, the star's brightness can increase by several magnitudes, making it visible to the naked eye even from considerable distances. Following the eruption, l Car enters a period of relative quiescence before potentially undergoing another eruption in the future.

The eruptions of LBVs like l Car are significant events in stellar evolution.

As it expands, its surface temperature decreases, causing it to appear dimmer. As it contracts, its surface temperature increases, causing it to appear brighter. This regular expansion and contraction give rise to its characteristic variability.

The period-luminosity relation for Cepheid variables like U Carinae states that there is a direct relationship between the pulsation period of the star and its intrinsic luminosity. Longer-period Cepheids are generally more luminous than shorter-period ones. By studying the period-luminosity relation and calibrating it with nearby Cepheids whose distances are known, astronomers can then apply this relation to measure distances to other galaxies.

V Carinae (V Car) is a variable star located in the constellation Carina. It is classified as a classical Cepheid variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star that exhibits regular and predictable changes in brightness.

Cepheid variables like V Car are massive, luminous stars that undergo radial pulsations, meaning their outer layers expand and contract rhythmically. The pulsation period of V Car is approximately 35.52 days, during which its brightness changes significantly.

The variations in brightness of V Car are directly related to its pulsation period. As the star expands, its surface temperature decreases, causing it to become fainter. Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface temperature increases, leading to a brighter phase. This regular cycle of expansion and contraction results in a well-defined relationship between the period of pulsation and the intrinsic luminosity of the star, known as the period-luminosity relation.

The period-luminosity relation of Cepheid variables allows astronomers to use their observed periods to estimate their intrinsic luminosities. By comparing the intrinsic luminosity with the apparent brightness observed from Earth, the distance to the Cepheid star can be determined. This makes Cepheids like V Car valuable tools for measuring cosmic distances and calibrating the cosmic distance ladder.

V Car is considered a bright and well-studied Cepheid star. Its brightness variations have been extensively monitored and analyzed by astronomers, contributing to our understanding of stellar pulsations, stellar evolution, and the structure of the Milky Way galaxy. V Car and other Cepheids have played a crucial role in measuring the distances to nearby galaxies and determining the scale of the universe.

In summary, V Carinae (V Car) is a classical Cepheid variable star located in the constellation Carina. It exhibits regular variations in brightness with a period of approximately 35.52 days. The study of V Car and other Cepheid variables has important implications for distance measurements in astronomy and our understanding of stellar pulsations and evolution.

Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface temperature increases, leading to a brighter appearance.

V Centauri has a pulsation period of approximately 333 days, which is the time it takes for the star to complete one full cycle of expansion and contraction. During its maximum brightness phase, it can be easily visible to the naked eye, while during its minimum brightness phase, it becomes much fainter.

The variations in brightness of Mira variables like V Centauri are primarily attributed to a combination of several factors, including the size and structure of the star, the composition of its outer layers, and the energy transport processes within the star. These factors interact in a complex way to produce the observed pulsations.

\subsubsection*{ VW Cen }
VW Cen is a variable star located in the constellation Centaurus. It is classified as a W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type eclipsing binary star. W UMa stars are close binary systems in which the two stars orbit each other so closely that they share a common outer envelope.

In the case of VW Cen, the two stars in the binary system are in contact with each other, forming a common envelope. These stars are typically low-mass main-sequence stars. The close proximity of the stars and their shared envelope result in mutual gravitational interaction and mass transfer between them.

VW Cen exhibits regular and repeated eclipses as the two stars orbit each other. As one star passes in front of the other along our line of sight, it partially or completely blocks the light from the other star, resulting in a decrease in brightness. These eclipses occur with a period of about 0.413 days (roughly 9.9 hours).

The light curve of VW Cen shows a characteristic W-shaped pattern, which is typical for W UMa-type binary stars. The light curve variation is due to both the eclipses and the reflection effect, where the more massive star (the primary) heats up the surface of the companion star (the secondary), causing it to emit more light.

\subsubsection*{ X Sct }
X Scuti, also known as X Sct, is a variable star located in the constellation Scutum. It is classified as a classical Cepheid variable star. Cepheids are a type of pulsating variable stars that exhibit regular and predictable changes in brightness. They play a crucial role in astronomy as distance indicators, known as standard candles.

X Scuti is known for its characteristic pulsations, with a period of approximately 6.88 days. During its pulsation cycle, its brightness varies in a regular and repeatable pattern. The variations in brightness are directly related to the star's pulsation period, with brighter phases corresponding to larger sizes and temperatures, and dimmer phases corresponding to smaller sizes and cooler temperatures.

The pulsations of Cepheid variables are caused by a balance between the star's gravity and radiation pressure. As the star expands, its outer layers cool down and become less luminous. Eventually, gravity takes over, causing the star to contract and heat up, leading to a rise in brightness. This cyclical expansion and contraction process drives the pulsations observed in Cepheids like X Scuti.

The period-luminosity relation is a fundamental property of Cepheid variables. It states that there is a direct correlation between the pulsation period of a Cepheid and its intrinsic luminosity. This relation allows astronomers to determine the distance to Cepheid stars by measuring their pulsation periods and comparing them to their observed brightness.

The study of Cepheid variables like X Scuti has been pivotal in determining cosmic distances and understanding the scale of the universe. By accurately measuring the pulsation periods and apparent magnitudes of Cepheids, astronomers can calibrate the period-luminosity relation and use it to estimate distances to other galaxies and galactic clusters.

Moreover, Cepheid variables are important for testing and refining stellar evolution models. The observed properties of Cepheids provide constraints on the masses, ages, and evolutionary paths of these stars. By comparing theoretical models with observed data, astronomers can improve our understanding of stellar evolution and the physical processes occurring within Cepheids.

In summary, X Scuti is a classical Cepheid variable star located in the constellation Scutum.

CK Scuti is known for its irregular and dramatic changes in brightness. Normally, it shines at around 9th magnitude, but it can undergo sudden drops in brightness by several magnitudes, sometimes becoming nearly invisible to the naked eye. These declines in brightness can occur over a period of days to months, and the star slowly recovers its original brightness over weeks or months.

The cause of the variability in R CrB stars like CK Scuti is still not completely understood. It is believed to be related to the formation of carbon-rich dust clouds in the stellar atmosphere. These dust clouds block and absorb the star's light, causing the observed dimming. The exact mechanism responsible for the formation of these dust clouds is not yet known, but it is thought to be related to episodes of mass loss from the star.

R CrB stars are considered rare and intriguing objects in astronomy due to their unpredictable nature and the complexity of their variability. They are believed to be evolved stars, possibly in a late stage of their evolution, where the mass loss and dust formation processes play a significant role.

RU Scuti (RU Sct) is a variable star located in the constellation Scutum. It is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating red giant star known for its regular and large-amplitude variations in brightness.

Mira variables like RU Sct undergo long-period pulsations, typically ranging from 80 to 1,000 days or more. During its pulsation cycle, RU Sct experiences significant changes in its size, temperature, and luminosity. It goes through a phase of expansion, where its outer layers become cooler and the star becomes larger, followed by a contraction phase where it becomes hotter and smaller. This leads to variations in its brightness as observed from Earth.

The amplitude of RU Sct's brightness variations can be several magnitudes, making it easily observable by amateur astronomers. It typically reaches maximum brightness during its pulsation cycle, known as maximum light, and then gradually fades before brightening again. The period and amplitude of Mira variables like RU Sct can change over time, making their behavior somewhat unpredictable.

The study of Mira variables provides valuable insights into stellar evolution and the late stages of stellar life. These stars are near the end of their evolution, having exhausted their nuclear fuel and expanded into red giants. They pulsate due to a combination of processes, including changes in the helium ionization zone and the presence of shockwaves traveling through their atmospheres.

Z Sct undergoes pulsations with a period of approximately 6.97 days. During its pulsation cycle, its brightness varies from about magnitude 6.3 at its brightest to around magnitude 7.2 at its faintest. These variations in brightness are caused by the expansion and contraction of the star's outer layers.

The period of pulsation in Cepheid variables is directly related to their intrinsic luminosity, meaning that stars with longer periods are more luminous than those with shorter periods. This relationship, known as the period-luminosity relationship, allows astronomers to use Cepheids as distance indicators. By measuring the period of pulsation, they can estimate the intrinsic luminosity of the star and then compare it to the observed brightness to determine its distance.

Z Sct is particularly interesting because it exhibits a secondary period in addition to its primary pulsation period. This secondary period, known as the Blazhko effect, is a long-term modulation of the pulsation amplitude and phase. The cause of the Blazhko effect is not yet fully understood but is believed to be related to the interaction between the pulsations and the star's magnetic field.

\subsection{Scorpius}

\subsubsection*{ RY Sco }
RY Scorpii (RY Sco) is a well-known variable star located in the constellation Scorpius. It is classified as a type of variable star known as a recurrent nova or cataclysmic variable.

RY Sco is a binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star, typically a red giant or main-sequence star. The white dwarf is a highly compact remnant of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel, while the companion star transfers mass onto the white dwarf through an accretion disk. The periodic outbursts observed in RY Sco are a result of this mass transfer process.

During an outburst, RY Sco experiences a sudden and dramatic increase in brightness. The outburst occurs when the accretion disk becomes unstable and a significant amount of mass is transferred onto the white dwarf, leading to a thermonuclear explosion on its surface. This explosion results in a temporary increase in luminosity, often by several magnitudes. After the outburst, the system gradually returns to its quiescent state until another outburst occurs.

The recurrence time between outbursts in RY Sco is approximately 10-15 years, but the exact timing and amplitude of the outbursts can vary. The study of recurrent novae like RY Sco provides valuable insights into the dynamics of binary star systems, mass transfer processes, and the mechanisms behind thermonuclear explosions on white dwarfs.

\subsubsection*{ KQ Sco }
KQ Scorpii (KQ Sco) is a variable star located in the constellation Scorpius. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable, specifically an intermediate polar or magnetic cataclysmic variable.

Cataclysmic variables are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star, often a red dwarf. In the case of KQ Sco, the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field, which makes it an intermediate polar. This means that the white dwarf's magnetic field disrupts the accretion disk, causing the system to exhibit irregular and sometimes complex variations in brightness.

The variability of KQ Sco is caused by the transfer of mass from the companion star to the white dwarf. The companion star fills its Roche lobe and transfers material onto an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. The strong magnetic field of the white dwarf then channels the accreted material along the magnetic field lines, leading to accretion onto specific magnetic poles on the surface of the white dwarf. This process produces periodic variations in the brightness of KQ Sco.

The variability of KQ Sco can be observed across a wide range of wavelengths, from X-rays to radio waves. Observations at different wavelengths allow astronomers to study different aspects of the system, such as the accretion process and the interaction between the magnetic field of the white dwarf and the accretion disk.

The study of cataclysmic variables like KQ Sco helps to improve our understanding of binary star evolution, mass transfer processes, and the behavior of magnetic fields in compact objects. By observing and analyzing the variability of KQ Sco, astronomers can gain insights into the physical mechanisms and dynamics at play in cataclysmic variable systems.

Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface temperature increases, leading to a brighter appearance.

Y Sagittarii has a pulsation period of approximately 421 days. However, it is important to note that the period of Mira variables can sometimes vary slightly from cycle to cycle. During its maximum brightness phase, Y Sagittarii can become visible to the naked eye, while during its minimum brightness phase, it becomes much fainter.

The variations in brightness of Mira variables like Y Sagittarii are influenced by factors such as the star's size, mass, composition, and the energy transport processes occurring within it. These factors interact in a complex way to produce the observed pulsations.

The study of Mira variables provides insights into the late stages of stellar evolution, particularly the evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars. By studying the pulsations and characteristics of Mira variables, astronomers can gain information about the physical properties of the stars, including their mass, size, and surface temperature.

Mira variables are also important distance indicators in astronomy. They follow a well-defined period-luminosity relationship, which means that by measuring the period of pulsation, astronomers can estimate the intrinsic luminosity of the star. This, in turn, allows them to determine the star's distance based on its observed brightness.

In summary, Y Sagittarii (Y Sgr) is a Mira-type variable star located in the constellation Sagittarius.

In an eclipsing binary system, the two stars orbit each other in such a way that they periodically pass in front of each other as seen from Earth, causing variations in the system's brightness.

The primary star in the XX Sgr system is a spectral type B star, while the secondary star is a cooler companion star. The primary star is more massive and hotter than the secondary star. As the two stars orbit around their common center of mass, they undergo mutual eclipses, leading to regular changes in the system's brightness.

During the primary eclipse, when the cooler secondary star passes in front of the hotter primary star, the overall brightness of the system decreases. This is because the secondary star blocks some of the light coming from the primary star. The primary eclipse is typically deeper and longer in duration compared to the secondary eclipse, where the hotter primary star passes in front of the cooler secondary star.

The study of eclipsing binary systems like XX Sgr provides valuable information about the physical properties of the stars, such as their sizes, masses, and temperatures. By analyzing the light curve during eclipses and the timing of the eclipses, astronomers can derive parameters such as the orbital period, the inclination of the system, and the relative sizes and temperatures of the stars.

Eclipsing binaries are important for understanding stellar evolution, as they allow astronomers to directly measure the physical properties of the stars in the system. They provide empirical data that can be used to test and refine theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution.

In summary, XX Sagittarii (XX Sgr) is an eclipsing binary star system located in the constellation Sagittarius. It consists of a primary B-type star and a cooler secondary star. The periodic eclipses of the stars provide valuable information about their physical properties and contribute to our understanding of stellar evolution.

V350 Sagittarii, also known as V350 Sgr, is a variable star located in the constellation Sagittarius. It is classified as a classical Cepheid variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star used as a standard candle for distance measurements in astronomy.

Cepheid variables like V350 Sgr exhibit regular and predictable variations in their brightness, with a period directly related to their intrinsic luminosity. This relationship, known as the period-luminosity relation, allows astronomers to determine the distances to Cepheid variables and other objects in the universe.

V350 Sagittarii has a period of approximately 6.4 days, meaning it takes about 6.4 days to complete one pulsation cycle.

The variability of WZ Sgr is due to recurrent outbursts that occur periodically. These outbursts are caused by the transfer of mass from the companion star to the white dwarf through an accretion disk. The companion star fills its Roche lobe, and the material flows towards the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk in the process. As the matter accumulates in the accretion disk, it eventually becomes unstable and undergoes a sudden increase in brightness, resulting in an outburst.

The outbursts of WZ Sgr are characterized by a rapid rise in brightness followed by a slower decline back to its quiescent state. The typical duration of an outburst ranges from a few days to a few weeks. Between outbursts, the system remains in a relatively dim and stable state.

The study of novae like TT Aql is important for understanding the processes of mass transfer, accretion, and thermonuclear explosions in binary star systems. These events provide insights into the evolution of close binary systems, the behavior of white dwarf stars, and the release of energy through explosive phenomena in the Universe.



\subsection{Musca}

\subsubsection*{ S Mus }
S Muscae (S Mus) is a variable star located in the constellation Musca. It is classified as a classical Cepheid variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star with a regular and predictable period-luminosity relationship.

S Muscae undergoes radial pulsations, meaning it expands and contracts in a periodic manner. The period of variability for S Mus is approximately 8.24 days. During its pulsation cycle, the star's radius and temperature vary, which leads to changes in its overall luminosity.

The period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variables allows astronomers to determine their intrinsic luminosity based on their pulsation period. By measuring the apparent brightness of S Mus, astronomers can then calculate its distance from Earth. This relationship is crucial for determining distances to nearby galaxies and establishing the cosmic distance ladder.

Cepheid variables like S Mus have been essential in measuring distances to various galaxies and determining the scale of the universe. They played a key role in the discovery of the expansion of the universe and the estimation of the Hubble constant.

Studying S Mus and other Cepheid variables provides valuable insights into stellar evolution, the physics of pulsating stars, and the measurement of cosmic distances. These stars are widely used as standard candles for distance measurements and serve as critical tools in understanding the structure, evolution, and age of galaxies.








\subsubsection*{ UU Mus }
UU Muscae (UU Mus) is a variable star located in the constellation Musca. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable, specifically as a dwarf nova. Dwarf novae are binary star systems in which a white dwarf star accretes matter from a companion star, resulting in periodic outbursts of brightness.

In the case of UU Muscae, the binary system consists of a white dwarf and a companion star, likely a low-mass main sequence star. The white dwarf accretes matter from the companion star, forming an accretion disk around it. Periodically, the matter in the accretion disk becomes unstable and triggers an outburst, causing an increase in brightness.

The outbursts of UU Muscae can be observed on timescales of a few days to weeks. During an outburst, the overall brightness of the system increases significantly, sometimes by several magnitudes. These outbursts are followed by a gradual decline in brightness as the system returns to its quiescent state.

The exact mechanism behind the outbursts in dwarf novae like UU Muscae is still a subject of ongoing research. However, it is believed to involve instabilities in the accretion disk, such as a thermal-viscous instability known as the "disk instability model." This model suggests that the outbursts are triggered by a sudden increase in the rate of mass transfer from the companion star to the white dwarf, leading to an enhanced accretion process.

Studying dwarf novae like UU Muscae provides insights into the accretion processes and interactions in binary star systems. They are also important for understanding the evolution of cataclysmic variables and the behavior of white dwarf stars.

\subsection{Norma}

\subsubsection*{ U Nor }
U Nor is a variable star located in the constellation Norma. It is classified as a recurrent nova, specifically a dwarf nova subtype. Recurrent novae are binary star systems in which a white dwarf star accretes matter from a companion star, leading to periodic explosive outbursts.

In the case of U Nor, the binary system consists of a white dwarf and a companion star, likely a main sequence or subgiant star. The white dwarf accretes matter from the companion, forming an accretion disk around it. When enough matter accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf, a thermonuclear runaway occurs, resulting in a sudden and dramatic increase in brightness.

During an outburst, U Nor can experience a significant increase in brightness, sometimes by several magnitudes. These outbursts can last for several days to weeks before the system returns to its quiescent state. The time between consecutive outbursts, known as the recurrence period, can vary from several years to several decades.

The exact mechanism that triggers the outbursts in recurrent novae like U Nor is still a subject of ongoing research. However, it is believed to involve the accumulation of a critical mass of accreted matter on the white dwarf's surface, which ignites a runaway nuclear reaction.

Studying recurrent novae like U Nor is important for understanding the accretion processes and explosive phenomena in binary star systems. These systems provide valuable insights into the physics of white dwarf stars, accretion disks, and the dynamics of mass transfer in close binary systems.

\subsubsection*{ QZ Nor }
QZ Normae, also known as QZ Nor, is a variable star located in the constellation Norma. It is classified as a W Virginis type variable star, which is a subtype of pulsating variable stars known for their distinct light curve patterns and periods.

W Virginis stars, including QZ Nor, exhibit a unique type of pulsation known as the "beat Cepheid" pulsation. These stars have periods typically ranging from 10 to 20 days and display alternating primary and secondary brightness maxima during their pulsation cycles.

QZ Nor specifically has a pulsation period of approximately 15.6 days. During each pulsation cycle, it goes through distinct stages of brightness variation. The primary maximum is typically brighter and shorter in duration compared to the secondary maximum, which is fainter but longer-lasting.

The pulsation behavior of QZ Nor and other W Virginis stars is influenced by various physical processes occurring within the star. These processes include radial pulsations and changes in the ionization state of different elements in the star's outer layers. These variations in the ionization state lead to changes in opacity, which in turn affect the star's luminosity.

The study of QZ Nor and other W Virginis stars provides valuable insights into stellar pulsation mechanisms and stellar evolution. By analyzing their light curves and spectral characteristics, astronomers can refine theoretical models and gain a better understanding of the physical processes occurring within these stars.

Furthermore, QZ Nor and other W Virginis stars are important for distance measurements and calibration of the cosmic distance ladder. Their period-luminosity relationship allows astronomers to estimate their distances and determine the distances to other celestial objects in the universe.

In summary, QZ Nor is a W Virginis type variable star located in the constellation Norma. It exhibits a distinct pulsation pattern known as "beat Cepheid" pulsation, with alternating primary and secondary maxima. The study of QZ Nor contributes to our understanding of stellar pulsation mechanisms, stellar evolution, and distance measurements in the cosmos.



\subsection{Crux}
\subsubsection*{ SU Cru }
SU Cru (also known as Nova Crucis 1975) is a cataclysmic variable star located in the constellation Crux. It is classified as a classical nova, which is a type of cataclysmic variable characterized by periodic outbursts of brightness.

In 1975, SU Cru underwent a nova eruption, during which its brightness increased significantly over a short period of time. This nova event was observed and studied by astronomers, leading to its designation as Nova Crucis 1975.

The outburst of SU Cru was caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf star in a close binary system. The white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star, which accumulates on its surface. When the accumulated matter reaches a critical density and temperature, a thermonuclear explosion occurs, resulting in a rapid release of energy and an increase in brightness.

Following the nova eruption, brightness of SU Cru gradually declined over a period of time as the ejected material expanded and dissipated. The star eventually returned to its pre-nova quiescent state, with its brightness and behavior resembling that of a typical cataclysmic variable.

The study of classical novae like SU Cru provides important insights into the processes of mass transfer, accretion, and thermonuclear explosions in binary star systems. By observing and analyzing these events, astronomers can better understand the evolution of close binary systems, the dynamics of white dwarf stars, and the processes that lead to explosive phenomena in the Universe.



\subsection{Ophiuchus}

\subsubsection*{ Y Oph }
Y Oph is a variable star located in the constellation Ophiuchus. It is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating red giant star with long-period variations in brightness.

Mira variables like Y Oph undergo pulsations that cause them to vary in brightness over periods of several months to years. These pulsations are driven by the star's internal processes, specifically by changes in its outer layers. As the star expands and contracts, its temperature and luminosity change, leading to the observed variations in brightness.

The period of variability of Y Oph is approximately 370 days. However, it's important to note that the period can vary somewhat from one cycle to another, and the star's brightness changes are not strictly periodic.

During its pulsation cycle, Y Oph experiences a rapid increase in brightness followed by a slower decline. At its brightest, it can reach a maximum visual magnitude of around 7, making it visible to the naked eye under suitable observing conditions. At its dimmest, it can drop to a minimum magnitude of around 12 or lower.

The study of Mira variables like Y Oph provides valuable insights into the late stages of stellar evolution, particularly for intermediate-mass stars like Y Oph. These stars are nearing the end of their lives, having exhausted their nuclear fuel, and are in the process of shedding their outer layers into space. The mass loss from Mira variables contributes to the enrichment of the interstellar medium with newly synthesized elements and the formation of planetary nebulae.

Observations of Mira variables also help astronomers refine models of stellar evolution and understand the mechanisms driving the pulsations and mass loss in evolved stars. They also have implications for our understanding of the chemical and physical processes occurring in the universe.

\subsubsection*{ BF Oph }
BF Ophiuchi, also known as BF Oph, is a variable star located in the constellation Ophiuchus. It is classified as a cataclysmic variable, specifically a dwarf nova. Cataclysmic variables are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf star and a normal star that is often a red dwarf. In these systems, mass transfer from the companion star onto the white dwarf leads to intermittent outbursts and variations in brightness.

BF Oph exhibits characteristic patterns of variability and outbursts commonly seen in dwarf novae. It undergoes regular and rapid increases in brightness, known as outbursts, followed by periods of lower brightness called quiescence.

During an outburst, the brightness of BF Oph can increase by several magnitudes over a period of days or weeks. These outbursts occur due to a sudden increase in the rate of mass transfer from the companion star onto the accretion disk around the white dwarf. As material accumulates on the disk, it eventually becomes unstable and undergoes a rapid release of energy, causing the outburst.

After an outburst, BF Oph gradually returns to its lower brightness state, known as quiescence. During this period, the mass transfer rate decreases, and the accretion disk gradually dissipates. The system remains in quiescence until the next outburst occurs.

The study of BF Oph and other dwarf novae provides insights into the processes of mass transfer, accretion disks, and compact binary systems. Observations of these systems during different phases of their outburst cycles help astronomers understand the mechanisms responsible for the variations in brightness and the physics of accretion processes.

Additionally, cataclysmic variables like BF Oph are important for studying the physics of white dwarf stars, as well as the evolution and dynamics of binary star systems.

In summary, BF Ophiuchi is a cataclysmic variable star, specifically a dwarf nova, located in the constellation Ophiuchus. Its outbursts and variability in brightness are caused by mass transfer and accretion processes between the companion star and the white dwarf. The study of BF Oph contributes to our understanding of accretion physics, compact binary systems, and the evolution of white dwarfs.

\subsection{Serpens}


\subsubsection*{ AA Ser }
AA Ser is a variable star located in the constellation Serpens. It is classified as an eclipsing binary star system, meaning its brightness variations are caused by one star periodically passing in front of the other, resulting in eclipses.

In an eclipsing binary system like AA Ser, the two stars orbit around a common center of mass. When one star passes in front of the other as seen from Earth, it partially or completely blocks the light of the other star, causing a decrease in overall brightness. This results in regular and predictable variations in the observed brightness of the system.

The period of variability of AA Ser is approximately 1.8 days, which corresponds to the orbital period of the binary system. During the primary eclipse, the brighter star is partially or fully eclipsed by the dimmer star, resulting in a decrease in brightness. The secondary eclipse occurs when the dimmer star is partially or fully eclipsed by the brighter star, causing another decrease in brightness. These eclipses can be used to study the properties of the stars, such as their sizes, masses, and orbital parameters.

Eclipsing binary systems like AA Ser provide valuable information about stellar properties, including the sizes, masses, and temperatures of the stars involved. By analyzing the light curves during eclipses, astronomers can determine the geometry of the system, the orbital parameters, and even the presence of additional components such as exoplanets or circumstellar disks.

AA Ser and other eclipsing binary systems have important applications in astrophysics, such as testing models of stellar structure and evolution, studying stellar atmospheres, and refining distance measurements. They also offer insights into the formation and evolution of binary star systems and can provide clues about the processes that occur during stellar mergers or interactions.


\subsubsection*{ CR Ser }
CR Serpentis, also known as CR Ser, is a variable star located in the constellation Serpens. It is classified as a Mira variable, which is a type of pulsating variable star characterized by long periods and large changes in brightness.

Mira variables like CR Serpentis are typically evolved, red giant stars in the late stages of their evolution. They undergo regular pulsations with periods ranging from several months to a few years. During the pulsation cycle, the star's brightness can vary by several magnitudes.

The pulsations in CR Serpentis are caused by periodic expansions and contractions of its outer layers. As the star expands, its surface cools and dims, resulting in a decrease in brightness. Conversely, as the star contracts, its surface heats up and brightens. These changes in surface temperature and luminosity are driven by the interaction between gravitational forces and energy generation within the star's interior.

The variations in brightness of Mira variables like CR Serpentis are irregular in nature, with fluctuations occurring over timescales of weeks to months. The exact timing and magnitude of these variations can be unpredictable, making Mira variables challenging to study. However, astronomers can observe and analyze the light curve of CR Serpentis, which shows the changes in brightness over time, to derive important information about the star's physical properties and pulsation behavior.

The study of Mira variables provides valuable insights into stellar evolution, mass loss processes, and the late stages of stellar life. These stars are known to undergo significant mass loss through stellar winds, contributing to the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements. They also play a crucial role in the recycling of material back into the galaxy.

Furthermore, Mira variables are important for distance measurements in astronomy. Their period-luminosity relationship, known as the Mira period-luminosity relation, allows astronomers to estimate their distances based on their observed periods and apparent magnitudes. This relationship has been extensively used in the determination of distances to nearby galaxies and the calibration of the cosmic distance ladder.

In summary, CR Serpentis is a Mira variable star located in the constellation Serpens. Its regular pulsations and large variations in brightness are caused by expansions and contractions of its outer layers. The study of CR Serpentis and similar Mira variables contributes to our understanding of stellar evolution, mass loss processes, and distance measurements in astronomy.

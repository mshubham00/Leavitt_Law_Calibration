\begin{notebox}[sharp corners, width=\textwidth]{Knowledge of Distance is fundamental in astronomy.}
Distance enables us to convert the sky’s seemingly two-dimensional projection into a three-dimensional representation of the Universe. Once the distance to a bright object is known, its true luminosity can be determined, allowing us to infer its size, mass, age and other physical characteristics.

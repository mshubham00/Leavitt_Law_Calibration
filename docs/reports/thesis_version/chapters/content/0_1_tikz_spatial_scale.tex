\caption{Cosmic distances span from nearby stars to the largest known structures in the universe, measured on scales of light-years, typically up to the order of 10. Each label represents either the distance to a notable astronomical object or the size of a vast cosmic region. The diameter of the observable universe is roughly 93 billion light-years, which is nearly the order of 11.}

	\caption{\textbf{Stellar Evolution of Sun-type star:} \textbf{a)} Gravitational collapse of a gas cloud forms a protostar which begin to fuse Hydrogen and arrived to the main sequence. \textbf{b)} After billions of years, star leaves the main sequence and become a Red Giant. At the tip of the Red Giant branch, star begin to fuse Helium after the episode of Helium flash and slowly moves to AGB phase \textbf{c)} Evolved star expanded upto the size of Jupiter orbit and loses its envelope to form a planetary nebula at the age of 12 billion years. \textbf{d)} Ejecting way the outer envelope, the remnant of dead star shines due to the degeneracy pressure of its electron and called as White Dwarf. \hfill Source: Stars and Nebula by William J.

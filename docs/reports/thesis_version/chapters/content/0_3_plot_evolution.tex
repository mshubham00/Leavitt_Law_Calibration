	\caption{Evolutionary cycle for low and high mass star. Low mass stars, like Sun, become a Red Giant when Hydrogen supply to the core stops and fusion takes place in the shell around the core. Afterwards they become a Planetary nebula with a bright core at the center and end their life as a White Dwarf, slowly get faded turning into brown dwarf. Massive stars evolve to Red Supergiant and end their life as Supernova leaving behind either a Neutron star or Black Hole.  [cmglee/NASA Goddard Space Flight Center] }		\label{evolution}

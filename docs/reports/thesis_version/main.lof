\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Evolutionary cycle for low and high mass star. Low mass stars, like Sun, become a Red Giant when Hydrogen supply to the core stops and fusion takes place in the shell around the core. Afterwards they become a Planetary nebula with a bright core at the center and end their life as a White Dwarf, slowly get faded turning into brown dwarf. Massive stars evolve to Red Supergiant and end their life as Supernova leaving behind either a Neutron star or Black Hole. [cmglee/NASA Goddard Space Flight Center] \relax }}{4}{figure.caption.5}%

At the tip of the Red Giant branch, star begin to fuse Helium after the episode of Helium flash and slowly moves to AGB phase \textbf {c)} Evolved star expanded upto the size of Jupiter orbit and loses its envelope to form a planetary nebula at the age of 12 billion years. \textbf {d)} Ejecting way the outer envelope, the remnant of dead star shines due to the degeneracy pressure of its electron and called as White Dwarf. \hfill Source: Stars and Nebula by William J.
